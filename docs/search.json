    "text": "Since I can remember, I’ve always loved cricket — it’s been a way of life for me. It allowed me to express myself, stay active, and build lifelong friendships. Every summer as a kid, whether in Ireland or visiting Pakistan, I’d spend hours playing cricket, often with family and friends.\nCricket was never just a game — it was a dream. But dreams require hard work. Over the past year, I’ve taken that seriously: analyzing my technique, reviewing my match performances, and breaking down what I need to improve — both mentally and physically."

    "text": "Performance Metrics & Stats\nOver the last two seasons, I’ve played for Carlow (2023) and then moved to North County (2024). I moved to experience a higher level of cricket. Here are some stats and breakdowns of my performance — from batting scores to wicket-taking form.\n\n\nNorth County (2024–2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlow (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move from Carlow to North County was a much-needed change. North County’s ground (The Inch) provided a far better playing environment, and I got the opportunity to compete at a higher level — going from Division 16 in Carlow to regularly playing Division 4 at North County.\nThis 12-division jump in just one year reflects the hard work and dedication I’ve put in, and it continues to motivate me. My total runs increased from 267 in 2023 to 567 in 2024, and my average also improved significantly — all while playing at a higher level.\nThe pie charts played a huge role in helping me understand how I was getting out. For example, frequent LBWs helped me realize that my head was falling across the stumps, making me unbalanced. By identifying these patterns, I was able to make technical corrections and improve my consistency.\nI still have a long way to go, but the data has given me the clarity and confidence that I’m moving in the right direction."
