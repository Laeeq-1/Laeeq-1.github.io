    "text": "Since I can remember, I’ve always loved cricket — it’s been a way of life for me. It allowed me to express myself, stay active, and build lifelong friendships. Every summer as a kid, whether in Ireland or visiting Pakistan, I’d spend hours playing cricket, often with family and friends.\nCricket was never just a game — it was a dream. But dreams require hard work. Over the past year, I’ve taken that seriously: analyzing my technique, reviewing my match performances, and breaking down what I need to improve — both mentally and physically.\n\n\n\nOver the last two seasons, I’ve played for Carlow (2023) and then moved to North County (2024). I moved to experience a higher level of cricket. Here are some stats and breakdowns of my performance — from batting scores to wicket-taking form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year of cricket has taught me something new. I’ve used coding to visualize performance trends and stats, helping me identify weaknesses and build confidence. This is just the beginning of my journey.\nStay tuned — this is only the start. 🏏🔥"
