Every summer as a kid, whether in Ireland or visiting Pakistan, Iâ€™d spend hours playing cricket, often with family and friends.\nCricket was never just a game â€” it was a dream. But dreams require hard work. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve taken that seriously: analyzing my technique, reviewing my match performances, and breaking down what I need to improve â€” both mentally and physically."

    "text": "Performance Metrics & Stats\nOver the last two seasons, Iâ€™ve played for Carlow (2023) and then moved to North County (2024). I moved to experience a higher level of cricket. Here are some stats and breakdowns of my performance â€” from batting scores to wicket-taking form.\n\n\nNorth County (2024â€“2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlow (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move from Carlow to North County was a much-needed change. North Countyâ€™s ground (The Inch) provided a far better playing environment, and I got the opportunity to compete at a higher level â€” going from Division 16 in Carlow to regularly playing Division 4 at North County.\nThis 12-division jump in just one year reflects the hard work and dedication Iâ€™ve put in, and it continues to motivate me. My total runs increased from 267 in 2023 to 567 in 2024, and my average also improved significantly â€” all while playing at a higher level.\nThe pie charts played a huge role in helping me understand how I was getting out. For example, frequent LBWs helped me realize that my head was falling across the stumps, making me unbalanced. By identifying these patterns, I was able to make technical corrections and improve my consistency.\nI still have a long way to go, but the data has given me the clarity and confidence that Iâ€™m moving in the right direction."
