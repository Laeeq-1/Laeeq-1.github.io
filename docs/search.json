This scholarship is given to students from the Access programme who have shown outstanding academic achievement, resilience, and promise. Coming from an Access background, I understood the weight of this recognition. It was more than a financial award ‚Äî it was a statement that my hard work and consistency mattered. I was deeply honoured to be seen as someone worthy of carrying that legacy forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe &lt;strong&gt;Ann&lt;/strong&gt; award was especially meaningful to me. Voted by my peers in 6th year at CBS, it recognized the person in our year who best embodied kindness, support, and being a genuinely \"sound\" individual. What made this even more touching was that I started secondary school knowing no one. To end it with this kind of recognition showed me how far I'd come, not just academically, but socially and personally. As part of receiving the award, I had the honour of delivering a speech in front of the entire student body and their parents at our end-of-year ceremony. Receiving a standing ovation at the end was something I‚Äôll never forget ‚Äî it was truly amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nKubicle Certificates\n\n  \n\nClick the image to view all my verified Kubicle certificates."

North County‚Äôs ground (The Inch) provided a far better playing environment, and I got the opportunity to compete at a higher level ‚Äî going from Division 16 in Carlow to regularly playing Division 4 at North County.\nThis 12-division jump in just one year reflects the hard work and dedication I‚Äôve put in, and it continues to motivate me. My total runs increased from 267 in 2023 to 567 in 2024, and my average also improved significantly ‚Äî all while playing at a higher level.\nThe pie charts played a huge role in helping me understand how I was getting out. For example, frequent LBWs helped me realize that my head was falling across the stumps, making me unbalanced. By identifying these patterns, I was able to make technical corrections and improve my consistency.\nI still have a long way to go, but the data has given me the clarity and confidence that I‚Äôm moving in the right direction."
