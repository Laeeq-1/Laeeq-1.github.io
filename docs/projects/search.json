I implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest in Python, and compared performance using metrics such as F1 score, recall, and ROC AUC.\n\n\nThe focus was on balancing predictive accuracy with interpretability. I also produced a 3,000-word reflective report covering methodology, KPI analysis, and the ethical context of using AI in healthcare.\nClick the image to read the full report."
