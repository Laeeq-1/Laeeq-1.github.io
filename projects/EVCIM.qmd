    <p><strong>Creating the Foundation</strong></p>
    <p>We started by recovering recycled metal from abandoned mattresses. The springs were heated to straighten them and then cut using a plier. This metal was mixed with concrete to create our homemade weight plates.</p>

    <p><strong>Painting the Weights</strong></p>
    <p>Once the concrete dried, the plates were coated in matte black paint. At this stage, we finalized the 5kg weight plate design. However, we could only produce six at a time.</p>

    <p><strong>Our Finished Product</strong></p>
    <p>The result: clean, consistent 5kg concrete weights reinforced with metal. A major milestone, but we weren’t done yet.</p>

    <p><strong>Experimenting with Moulds</strong></p>
    <p>To scale up, we began developing a more consistent mould using recycled plastics. The aim was to perfect a system that would always produce identical weights.</p>

    <p><strong>Drying Rack Innovation</strong></p>
    <p>We repurposed discarded wooden planks to build a drying rack. This allowed us to cure multiple weights simultaneously and improve our workflow.</p>

<p><em>This clip shows part of our early-stage process: heating and bending metal taken from mattress springs — a key reinforcement element in the final weight.</em></p>

### Transport Tactics

    <p><em>You might be wondering how we brought the mattresses home...</em></p>
    <p><strong>This is how.</strong> Do not try this at home — unless you're feeling lucky and you have a very good excuse to the guards.</p>

### Reflection

At the core of the EVCIM project is a belief that **fitness should be accessible to everyone**. Gym equipment, especially weights, can be expensive — but through recycling, creativity, and sheer trial-and-error, we’ve managed to design **affordable, functional weights** from materials that would’ve ended up in landfills.

We’re not just making plates — we’re building a **movement** where passion meets sustainability. And we’re not stopping until **everyone** can train, lift, and grow without breaking the bank.
