## Passion

Since I can remember, cricket has been a way of life. It let me express myself, stay active, and build lifelong friendships. Every summer — whether in Ireland or visiting Pakistan — I’d spend hours playing, often with family and friends.

But cricket was never just a game. It was a dream. And dreams demand hard work.

Over the last year, I’ve taken things seriously: analyzing technique, reviewing matches, and working on both my physical game and mental mindset.

## Performance Metrics & Stats

Over the last two seasons, I’ve represented **Carlow (2023)** and moved to **North County (2024)**. This move was about growth — playing higher-level cricket and pushing myself beyond comfort zones.

Here's how my performance evolved:

### Interpreting the Journey

Moving from **Division 16** at Carlow to **Division 4** at North County was a 12-division leap in one year — something I’m incredibly proud of.

My total runs jumped from **267 in 2023** to **567 in 2024**, with a major bump in batting average — all while facing better bowlers on tougher wickets.

The data helped me massively:
- High LBW rates in 2023 told me my head was falling across the stumps.
- I used that to fix my alignment, improve balance, and find more consistency.

##  Reflection

Every season teaches something new. This time, I brought in **coding** to visualize my stats, study my dismissals, and shape my goals.

It's helped me improve technically, mentally, and tactically — and it’s only the beginning.
