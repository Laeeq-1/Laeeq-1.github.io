# 🏏 Laeeq’s Cricketing Journey

Since I can remember, I’ve always loved cricket — it’s been a way of life for me. It allowed me to express myself, stay active, and build lifelong friendships. Every summer as a kid, whether in Ireland or visiting Pakistan, I’d spend hours playing cricket, often with family and friends.

Cricket was never just a game — it was a dream. But dreams require hard work. Over the past year, I’ve taken that seriously: analyzing my technique, reviewing my match performances, and breaking down what I need to improve — both mentally and physically.
