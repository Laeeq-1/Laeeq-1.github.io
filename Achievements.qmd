  As captain of the CBS hurling team, I led our school with pride and commitment. This role taught me responsibility, communication, and leadership both on and off the field. In my final year we won the South leinster final , which was unbelievable and is one of my most memorable memories from secondary school.

  Being awarded the <strong>Scholarship</strong> was one of the proudest moments of my academic journey. This scholarship is given to students from the Access programme who have shown outstanding academic achievement, resilience, and promise. Coming from an Access background, I understood the weight of this recognition. It was more than a financial award — it was a statement that my hard work and consistency mattered. I was deeply honoured to be seen as someone worthy of carrying that legacy forward.

<p style="max-width: 600px;">
  The <strong>Ann</strong> award was especially meaningful to me. Voted by my peers in 6th year at CBS, it recognized the person in our year who best embodied kindness, support, and being a genuinely "sound" individual. What made this even more touching was that I started secondary school knowing no one. To end it with this kind of recognition showed me how far I'd come — not just academically, but socially and personally. As part of receiving the award, I had the honour of delivering a speech in front of the entire student body and their parents at our end-of-year ceremony. Receiving a standing ovation at the end was something I’ll never forget — it was truly amazing.
