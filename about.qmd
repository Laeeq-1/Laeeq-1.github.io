## My Cricket Journey

<div class="card">
  <p>
    Cricket has been at the heart of my life. Over the years, I’ve moved clubs and climbed divisions — pushing myself physically and mentally.
    I use analytics and self-review to track my performances and grow as a player.

  <p>
    I co-founded a startup repurposing scrap metal into recyclable weights.  
    I handled everything from door-to-door sales to backend logic and automation systems — learning how lean businesses truly run.

## Real-World Work Experience 

<div class="card">
  <p>
    For 4+ years, I’ve worked at Golden Grill, a family-run restaurant in Carlow.  
    There I manage tills, assist with stock, and even jump into the kitchen at times.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s taught me the importance of customer service, teamwork, and community engagement — things no textbook can teach.
