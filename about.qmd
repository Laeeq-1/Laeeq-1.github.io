## My Cricket Journey

<div class="card">
  <p>
    Cricket shaped who I am. I've progressed through clubs and divisions, growing both mentally and physically.  
    I now use data-driven self-analysis to track my performances, refine technique, and lead by example.

## My Business Hustle – EVCIM

  <img src="projects/weights.jpg" alt="EVCIM weights" style="width:100%; max-width:400px; border-radius: 10px; display:block; margin: 10px auto;" />
  <p>
    EVCIM is a recycled weights business I co-founded — transforming scrap into smart, sustainable products.  
    I handled everything from design and manufacturing to customer outreach and backend automation.  
    This project taught me how to build from the ground up, with limited resources but limitless drive.
