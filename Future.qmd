With a strong foundation in cricket and an entrepreneurial mindset, my future pathway is shaped by both athletic ambition and business vision.  
From a young age, cricket has been more than just a game for me — it’s been a way of life.  
As I continue to develop my skills, my next big goal is to pursue cricket professionally.

To achieve this, I am planning to train even harder, push my physical and mental limits, and potentially explore opportunities to train abroad, where I can be exposed to higher competition and better facilities.  
I believe that challenging myself in new environments will accelerate my growth and help me reach international standards.

At the same time, I’m not just building my career on the field — I’m also building it off the field.  
Through this web development project (as part of my academic work), I’ve realised how valuable technical skills can be in growing a personal brand or business.

Going forward, I intend to launch my own cricket coaching business or cricket-related initiative.  
Building a professional website for it — using the skills I gained during this module — will be one of my first steps.  
Having an online presence will allow me to showcase my journey, attract clients, and expand my impact beyond just local communities.

Ultimately, my goal is to blend my passion for cricket with entrepreneurship, creating a career where I can lead, inspire, and keep growing — both on the pitch and in business.
